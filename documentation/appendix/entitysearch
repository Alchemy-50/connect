Searching for Specific People or Other Entities
===============================================
Connect offers several ways to find specific entities -- people, sports teams and musical groups. You can search for entities using keywords (such as the name of a person or group, plus related concepts such as "headshot" or "red carpet"). You can also use various search parameters (such as specifying MostPopular in the EditorialSortOrder parameter when querying for editorial assets).

Beginning in December 2013, Connect released a beta for a new query parameter to automatically retrieve accurate, targeted and unambiguous search results by searching with exact entity IDs rather than keywords. This functionality ties in to the expanding <a href="http://lod-cloud.net/">Linked Open Data community</a> of metadata using the common language of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs).

Linked Data Sources
-------------------
We've linked more than 60,000 individuals to the metadata in the following external data sources:
*	DBPedia
*	Freebase
*	MusicBrainz

We continually review search trends and add names to our named persons list as people become well-known or frequently searched for.

-----------
You can specify the Linked Data URI in the EntityUris query parameter of our Search operations, SearchForImages or SearchForVideos.

If you aren't already mapping to a linked data source and referencing linked data URIs, you can obtain the URI by searching in one of the following sources:

| Data Source | How to Build Your URI | Example URIs |
|:------------|:----------------------|:-------------|
| DBPedia | Search for the entity at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org">http://en.wikipedia.org</a>, and then append the named suffix to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/">http://dbpedia.org/resource/</a>. | <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Smith_(musician)">http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Smith_(musician)</a> <br/> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Beyoncé_Knowles">http://dbpedia.org/resource/Beyoncé_Knowles</a> |
| Freebase | Search for the entity at <a href="http://www.freebase.com/">http://www.freebase.com/</a>. | <a href="http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.01tp5bj">http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.01tp5bj</a> <br/> <a href="http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.01mpq7s">http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.01mpq7s</a> |
| MusicBrainz | Search for the entity at <a href="http://musicbrainz.org/">http://musicbrainz.org/</a>. | <a href="http://musicbrainz.org/artist/7d1a1624-784b-4f89-8ff9-b9b493cd059d ">http://musicbrainz.org/artist/7d1a1624-784b-4f89-8ff9-b9b493cd059d </a> <br/> <a href="http://musicbrainz.org/artist/859d0860-d480-4efd-970c-c05d5f1776b8">http://musicbrainz.org/artist/859d0860-d480-4efd-970c-c05d5f1776b8</a> |

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------
<b>What if the entity URI I'm searching for isn't among the 60,000 people you've mapped?</b>
The API will return zero results. In this case, try a free text keyword search (with the SearchPhrase query parameter). Be sure to also set the EditorialSortOrder to "MostPopular" or "Trending" to get the most relevant images first in your results.

<b>What if the entity is not a person, such as a sports team, band, movie or event?</b>
We plan to expand this service and link to different types of entities over time, so be sure to let us know what you'd like to see next!

<b>Why am I getting the error URI resolution failed?</b>
Connect will return the UriResolutionFailed status code with the message "Indicates URI resolution failed for one or more entity URIs" when the URI is malformed. Refer to the table in the "Tell Me How" section for how to properly format each URI.

<b>Why am I getting the error unknown provider URI?</b>
Connect will return the status code, UnknownProviderUri, with the message, "Indicates an entity URI from an unsupported provider was specified," if the entity URI is from a data source other than those we have linked to. If you rely on a particular data source for your business, be sure to let us know so that we can review our policies and consider it for the future.

<b>How do I get images of just that person or otherwise refine the results?</b>
You have a few options to work with. We recommend using a combination of EditorialSortOrder and SearchPhrase query parameter. For example:

* Set the EditorialSortOrder parameter to MostPopular or Trending.
* Add "one person" in the SearchPhrase query parameter to get results for just that person.
* Add keywords such as "headshot," "head and shoulders," or "waist up."
